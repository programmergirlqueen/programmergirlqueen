They're an extraordinary wellspring of simple to-accumulate wood, and in Valheim you're going to assemble wood a great deal. However, don't slam the cabins with a weapon! All things considered, utilize your making mallet to make a workbench, drop it on the floor inside the shack, and afterward begin obliterating the structure (center tapping the mouse while you're holding your sledge will annihilate dividers, floors, and rooftop pieces)."

Some have money boxes with plunder, and others have colonies of bees that will give you a sovereign honey bee when annihilated, which you can use to fabricate your own hive."
